This deep learning project implements a custom convolutional neural network architecture named **PDCOVIDNet** to detect **COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal** chest X-ray images. Developed as part of the **_Computer Vision and Robotics_** course, the project was inspired by the research paper:

üìÑ **PDCOVIDNet: A Parallel-Dilated Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Detecting COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images**  
*Chowdhury et al., Health Information Science and Systems (2020)*  
[DOI: 10.1007/s13755-020-00119-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13755-020-00119-3)

## üöÄ Features
- Custom CNN architecture (PDCOVIDNet) with parallel dilated convolution blocks
- Binary and multi-class classification of chest X-ray images (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal)
- Handles class imbalance using WeightedRandomSampler and class-weighted loss
- Image augmentation techniques for robust training (rotation, affine transform, grayscale)
- Macro-averaged evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
- Visualization of dataset distribution and classification results

## üìä Dataset
- **Kaggle Dataset**: [Chest X-ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alsaniipe/chest-x-ray-image)
- 3 Classes: `COVID19`, `PNEUMONIA`, `NORMAL`
- Images are resized to **224√ó224**, and grayscale conversion is applied

## üß† Model Architecture
- **Input**: 224√ó224 grayscale chest X-ray image
- **Two Parallel Branches**:
  - 5√ó DilatedConvBlock (Conv2D ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Conv2D ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPool2D)
    - Branch 1: Dilation rate = 1
    - Branch 2: Dilation rate = 2
- **Fusion**:
  - Element-wise addition of both branches
  - Conv2D (3√ó3, 512 filters) to refine merged features
- **Flatten**
- **Fully Connected Layers**:
  - Dense(1024) ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Dropout(0.3)
  - Dense(1024) ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Dropout(0.3)
  - Dense(3) ‚Üí Output logits (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal)
